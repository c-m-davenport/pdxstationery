# PDX stationery
Portland Stationery is a hub and blog website for Portlanders to figure out what stationery store is best for them to go to. 

This website is a bit of a pet-project that I intened to slowly make a better and better source. The site is likely to also include a blog at https://pdxstationery.com/blog, so if that interests you, feel free to check it out too!
